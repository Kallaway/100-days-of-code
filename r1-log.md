The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on November 09, Friday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 - November 09, 2018
Started my first lesson on FreeCodeCamp.org, working with HTML5
	
	**Thoughts:** I have only dabbled in HTML during college and even then it wasn't significant.  I am excited to go more in depth with the lessons here.  Looking ahead I am a little intimidated but I think it will be exciting nonetheless.

### R1D2 - November 10, 2018
Basic CSS Styling today.  I worked on changing color and size of text as well as discerning the difference and heirarchy of classes and attribute ID's.

	**Thoughts:** There were a few lessons I had to watch some videos on in order to complete.  After doing so, I realized I was overthinking simple things and knew the answer.  As I move forward I hope to fix that by putting CSS into practical use.

### R1D3 - November 11, 2018
Today's lesson was on Applied Visual Design.  I used this day to also learn some more of markup and git in order to update these logs appropriately.

	**Thoughts:** Today was a bit of a sensory overload with trying to understand complimentary and tertiary color groups.  I enjoyed learning gradients.

### R1D4 - November 12, 2018
Moved into accessibility work on FreeCodeCamp.org, making webpages accessible to those with disabiliites.  Also tried to work on my tribute page.
	
	**Thoughts:** I am not confident enough in my HTML abilities to work on my tribute page without having to constantly check the example and see what they did.  Need to work on the basics some more.

### R1D5 - November 13, 2018
CSS Flexbox and CSS grid today

	**Thoughts:** I enjoyed learning about the ability to layout webpages utilizing flexbox and grid though it was a lot of material to take in.  I am looking for supplemental material to go with my FreeCodeCamp.org work.

### R1D6 - November 14, 2018
Took a break from HTML to work on Swift

	**Thoughts:** Swift was what interested me in programming and coding so I decided to take a break from my HTML lessons and do some work with Xcode.  I started the iOS development boot camp from Udemy and began work on my first test app

### R1D7 - November 15, 2018
Continuing working with Swift

	**Thoughts:** Worked with creating buttons, labels, and input fields in preparation of making a simple app with user interaction

### R1D8 - November 16, 2018
Finished my first Swift App

	**Thoughts:** Completed my first app through Xcode which allowed me to calculate my cat's age.  I learned how to convert a string into an integer then back into a string.

### R1D9 - November 17, 2018
Began Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy

	**Thoughts:** After taking an HTML break, I decided I wanted to tackle it again, despite my anxiety with it.  I started a new bootcamp at Udemy to supplement the training I was doing on FreeCodeCamp.org.

### R1D10 - November 18, 2018
Web Development on Udemy building tables without CSS

	**Thoughts:** I was able to get a better grasp on building tables into my HTML thought without the use of CSS at this point so they are still very basic.  I built a webpage table from scratch without the use of notes or help so I can say I know more now than I did yesterday!
