# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Bill Hall]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 9, 2020].

## Log
I copied some requirements from a job listing that I would like to have, and will focus on learning those requirements initially. Since I am interested in a front end position, I will mainly focus on learning front end stuff.

Requirements:

    You have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS.
    You keep up with the latest technologies (CSS Grid, Flexbox, Web Animations API, Observers, etc.) and understand how and when to use feature detection, polyfills, @supports, and vendor-prefixes to provide cross-browser support.
    You are comfortable with templating engines like Mustache or Handlebars.
    You have experience using RESTful APIs in your applications.

Preferred Requirements:

    Familiarity with Vue.js or similar frameworks is a plus.
    Familiarity with progressive enhancement is a plus.
    Familiarity with MongoDB or other NoSQL databases is a plus.

### R1D1 
 For today, October 9, 2020, I created a simple counter app, using Bulma and Fontawesome, and vanilla javascript. You can see the counter <a href="https://codewriting.dev/100daysofcode/counter/index.html">here</a>

### R1D2

For today, October 10, 2020, I combined the counter with a FizzBuzz solution. FizzBuzz is the classic challenge of how to replace multiples of 3 and 5 with the strings "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz"; multiples of 3 become "Fizz", multiples of 5 become "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 become "FizzBuzz". You can see the enhanced counter <a href="https://codewriting.dev/100daysofcode/day2">here</a>

### R1D3

For day 3, October 11, 2020, based on the suggestion of Sandra, I added some information to the page to explain why seemingly random text appeared next to certain numbers in the counter. You can find this version <a href="https://codewriting.dev/100daysofcode/day3">here</a>

### R1D4
