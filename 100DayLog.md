# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2019

**Today's Progress** I finished basic HTML on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Im pretty slow, I'm trying to develop a good habit of touch typing, to increase my speed and consistency.

**Link(s) to work** I have not yet published work..... I will soon!


### Day 2: September 29, 2019

**Today's Progress** I Started CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** Second day! Now it is more than just a one of hour! My streak begins. CSS is pretty cool, I am starting to get a feel for what its like to write code, CSS is more rewarding/interesting for me than HTML.

**Link(s) to work** Soon I will create and publish my own project.


### Day 3: September 30, 2019

**Today's Progress** Finished CSS, now onto Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts** I am getting faster every day, and its only day 3! I am finding it quite hard to post on twitter and fill out this log, after my hour of code, I think the coding is priority so sometimes I create a log 1 day late.

### Day 4: September 30, 2019

**Today's Progress** Moving text around in Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts** I only did 30 minutes in the morning, then I had a really tough day, losing my phone and getting stuck in an unfamiliar city without much money to get home/food. Its because I spent it all on a coding book! A book on Web Design, Its nice and easy to read, now i have 1 more way to learn. I resisted the temptation to break my streak today. It is tempting to just add 1 day to the end of the challenge. I stayed strong and did another 30 minutes on freecodecamp when all I wanted to do was sleep or play a computer game. I win!
