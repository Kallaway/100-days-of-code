**#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anubis Lockward**
**The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 6, Thursday, 2018].**

**Log**

**R1D1 - December 6th, 2018**
Completed two Pomodoros on freecodecamp's Applied Visual Design curriculum. This is something I made from a previous example on the basic HTML and CSS part of the course: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice.html

**R1D2 - December 7th, 2018**
Kept advancing on the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. The published site on GitHub pages should be updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's an improved version of the previous CatPhotoApp with visuals improved a bit: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D3 - December 8th, 2018**
Did some lessons of the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. Confirmed that the published GitHub page for the CatPhotoApp is updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's the current version: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D4 - December 9th, 2018**
Today I didn't advance on freecodecamp because I decided to start working on my online CV, I've always wanted to make one and I think that it is coming along nicely. Found a way to add collapsible lists using CSS only. Here's the mockup? layout? how do you call this thing? Anyways, here's the link: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D5 - December 10th, 2018**
Added a navbar to the CV to navigate between sections. Added anchors for correct positioning when navigation on the page using the navbar. Also discovered that the css file was not linking correctly to the published page and fixed it.

**R1D6 - December 11th, 2018**
Made the CatPhotoApp look psychedelic with a bunch of colors and crazy animations. Also changed the folder structure for the project. Check it out at the Portfolio website. https://mr2much.github.io/webdev

**R1D7 - December 12th, 2018**
The stars on the CatPhotoApp are now displayed at each side of the "main window" instead of at the top, I was reducing the width of the BODY element, I changed it to reduce the width of the main container instead. Also finished the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp, going to start the Applied Accessibility Challenges.

**R1D8 - December 13th, 2018**
Did some of the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp, and it's finally here, my customized landing page for the online portfolio, tremble world for I am powerful: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D9 - December 14th, 2018**
Did two pomodoros for the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp.

**R1D10 - December 16th, 2018**
Finished the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp and started with Responsive Web Design and toying around with Flexbox.

**R1D11 - December 16th, 2018**
I think I added two entries today, don't know how to count it, one was around 1 AM and this one around 9 PM. Did an unhealthy amount of HTML/CSS learning today, feel great! Check out the cool TODO List I started making at my Portfolio site: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D12 - December 18th, 2018**
Today I experimented a bit more with flexbox and started learning around display: grid. It makes me think of bootstrap for some reason.

**R1D13, R1D14, R1D15 - December 19th, 20th, 21st, 2018**
I have poked around a lot learning css tricks and best practices, I also updated my Registration Form, made it look a lot cooler IMO and I also implemented a bunch of cool looking tricks and learned about the importance of labels to make forms accessible, check it out on my portfolio: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D16, R1D17 - December 22nd, 23rd, 2018**
I have been having fun learning different tricks and stuff you can do in CSS for the past couple of days. I improved my form and I think that it looks pretty good, anyone willing to give me feedback? check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlineform/html/index

**R1D18, R1D19, R1D20, R1D21, R1D22, December 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 2018**
I have been tweaking my Portfolio page and my projects, learning about using Grid and improving the overall look of my pages. I remade the Tribute Page I had made on CodePen, but did it locally on my laptop and uploaded it to my portfolio. Have been highly productive these past few days, working for more than two hours each day and I feel really happy. Haven't gotten the gist of making a webpage look good, but I know I'll get there eventually. Check out my latest progress at: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D23, R1D24, R1D25, R1D26, R1D27, R1D28, R1D29: December 30th, 31st, 2018; January 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 2019**
I have been having a lot of fun learning about using grid, flex-box and a bunch of other stuff. Have spent a couple of days working on my survey form project and another couple of days learning about typography and making the fonts look good on the website and how important it is for the user experience and overall feel of the website. I'm thinking about starting to implement what I've learned as I go. Have also been learning about webdesign and what is important to create a good layout. I should be updating my advancement with the 100 days of code challenge, but lately I've been focusing more on working than on posting. On days when I don't work specifically on the projects or updating my portfolio, I try to practice and learn about something else, making sure that I'm not letting my days go to waste. You can see my latest project at: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/surveyform/html/

**R1D30, R1D31, R1D32; January 5th, 6th, 7th, 2019**
On day 30 I made the social media links on the footer look a little better and added and effect to them when you hover over the links. I also learned about adding mailto:mail address as an href on the anchor tag property to open the default mail editor on the user's machine, which is nice.
 
On day 31 I was reading about and trying to understand CSS Locks, Molten Leading and Fluid Typography, and started implementing them on my Tribute Page project

On day 32 I still don't get fluid typography quite well, but I was following the guidelines of the following people:  

Geoff Graham
Tim Brown
Mike Riethmuller and this one
Richard Rutter

Finally, I made the text look better by following Matthew Butterick's advice on typography.

I'm not entirely happy with the look of the Tribute Page, and it still looks awful on my cell phone; but overall I think it looks good enough. I'm looking forward to the day that these concepts click on my brain but I guess that I'll get there with more practice and time.

**R1D33; January 8th, 2019**
I fixed the display on small devices by changing the max-width of the secondary image to be on "em" instead of a percentage of the parent div #secondary-img, I also removed the prefixed size of 500px entirely. Finally, to make the header look better on the smallest resolution, I changed the grid-template-rows to be (45vmin 1fr and 3%) instead of the (10% 1fr and 3%) that it was before.

Finished making the Tribute Page look good on mobile devices. Perhaps I should test a bit more before affirming that, but right now it display correctly on my cell phone. I removed some unnecessary stylings from my css file that were causing the page to display incorrectly. I also learned that mobile browsers scale the page down automatically and that that behavior could be controlled with a meta tag called viewport.

Started working on improving how my portfolio landing page looks on mobile devices (at least on mine), I need more feedback on this because I don't know if it looks good enough on other resolutions, I checked my portfolio page on my wife's phone and it didn't look as bad as I expected, even though I was navigating in Safari. At least the fluid typography was displaying on a readable manner. Right now I only improved the automatic scaling for mobile devices for my Portfolio and changed the background image size to be "contain" when the resolution is 700 pixels or less because the image was not scaling well.

**R1D34; January 9th, 2019**
Today I played around with fluid typography on my portfolio's landing page, I think it looks good enough. I also used Molten Leading for the line height and I think it looks good too. I still have to fix the sizes of the boxes on some resolutions which IMO they look kind of weird.

**R1D35, R1D36; January 10th, 11th, 2019**
Started working on the Product Landing page project. At first I had no idea how to begin, but then I found that I tried working on something similar back in October of 2017 when I used to do drop-shipping on eBay. I had an interesting layout and that's what I'm gonna try to recreate here. I will not add any Bootstrap at this point because I feel that that would be like cheating on myself, I rather keep doing this with pure and simple HTML and CSS for now. Maybe in the future I'll add more styling and improve the project a bit, that's what I have been doing for everything else so far. Check out the project here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/product/html/index

**R1D37; January 12th, 2019**
Worked on my Product Landing Page project. Spent a lot of time trying to make the footer span the full width of the page and start from the bottom. Also started working on the page's color schema. Is that what it is called? how do you call it? Anyways, checkout my progress here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/product/html/index

**R1D38; January 13th, 2019**
Finished working on the Product Landing Page project.

**R1D39; January 14th, 2019**
Started working on a new layout for my Portfolio Landing Page. Now you can see a small preview of the project before clicking on it. Took me a lot of time to achieve it but I'm really proud of myself. Should be done by tomorrow. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D40; January 15th, 2019**
Finished adding thumbnail previews for all the projects in my portfolio. Didn't code too much and the biggest issue was getting screenshots for my images. I found a library that supposedly creates images out of the pages, but haven't used it yet. Will have to improve in the future. For now, let's just keep advancing. Check out my latest update here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D41; January 16th, 2019**
Fixed the Online Registration Form project's layout on small displays. Now it looks great on mobile.

**R1D42; January 18th, 2019**
Practiced creating layouts using Grid Box. Also, didn't code much today because I spent the day watching animated movies.

**R1D43; January 19th, 2019**
Improved the overall look of the TODO List app and made it look good on small displays, at least on 320x568 it looks good both in portrait and landscape modes, while on 720x1280 it only looks good on portrait mode. I'll keep working on it. I also practiced some more on combaning Grid and Flex for creating layouts.

**R1D44; January 20th, 2019**
Improved look of buttons on the TODO list app and improved the fonts a little.

**R1D45; January 21th, 2019**
Created an image gallery and added it to my Portfolio page. I specially like the inner div containing a link and the little square giving credit to the authors containing another, without them conflicting with each other. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/imggallery/html/

**R1D46, R1D47; January 22nd, 23rd, 2019**
Advanced a little on the Web Development Bootcamp course, did the Blog Exercise and started adding bootstrap to the Product Landing Page project. I just added a jumbotron and customized it a little, and added fluid typography to it.

**R1D48, R1D49; January 24th, 25th, 2019**
Added bootstrap to the Product Landing Page Project and improved the display for mobile display on cellphone and iPad. Also changed the navbar and footer to bootstrap and customized them a little. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/product/html/index

**R1D50, R1D51; January 26th, 27th, 2019**
Experimented around with Grid Layout and Bootstrap 3, added an improved navbar to the Product Landing Page, added a jumbotron and fixed its footer. I also added bootstrap to the portfolio landing page, also fixed the footer, added a jumbotron and improved the layout of the projects by adding a grid inside another grid. Also made the Portfolio more mobile friendly by making it more responvie on different viewports. Check the changes here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D52, R1D53, R1D54; January 28th, 29th, 30th, 2019**
Have been experimenting with combining bootstrap, grid layout and flex layout. Also have been using bootstrap's glyphicons and font awesome's. Created a bootstrap image gallery and a landing page for an app. Will add them to my portfolio soon.

**R1D55; January 31st, 2019**
Experimented a bit with Bootstrap 4, nothing fancy, just learning some of the changes and testing some of the examples.

**R1D56; February 1st, 2019**
Modified my Portfolio page to use Bootstrap 4 instead of 3, added a navbar to it and started modifying its layout. Changing the preview thumbnails of the projects to use cards instead of the current implementation was kicking my ass at first, but I turned it around. Gonna finish tomorrow.

**R1D57, R1D58; February 2nd, February 3rd, 2019**
Finished changing my portfolio to show the projects using Bootstrap 4's Cards, and added a button to also take you to the GitHub project's code and another to take you to the live site. After that I learned a bit more about Bootstrap 4 and its utilities and stuff. Checkout the latest update here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D59; February 12th, 2019**
Took a couple days off the challenge, but now we're back on track. Spent the last couple of days creating private Java projects on BitBucket so that I can start uploading there too and made a new product landing page by following along a Pluralsight project, gotta make it responsive.

**R1D60, February 14th, 2019**
Yesterday I fiddled with a Java project that I made a couple of years ago trying to make the code easier to test while practicing some techniques to improve TDD and stuff. Today I learned some more about Bootstrap 4. Should I start a different challenge for the days when I'm tinkering with Java?

**R1D61, February 15th, 2019**
Added Bootstrap 4 to my online CV which only had custom CSS until now. Also replaced the navbar it had with a BS4 collapsible navbar. Also watched some videos about how to be more productive and coding workflows (again)

**R1D62, February 17th, 2019**
Changed a lot of stuff on my online CV by tinkering with Bootstrap 4, I think it looks a lot cooler now even if it is not as customized. I'll finish it on the next couple of days. Check it out at: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D63, R1D64, February 18th, 19th, 2019**
I've spent two days working on improving my online CV with Bootstrap 4. Moved around some things, changed others, added more sections and improved the CV for mobile display, check it: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D65, R1D66, R1D67, February 20th, 21st, 22nd, 2019**
I have been working on the footer of my online CV trying to recreate this cool looking social section that I saw on another website. I think that it looks pretty cool. It needs some adjustments here and there for mobile display, but that's for another day. Check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D68, February 24th, 2019**
Adjusted the footer a bit to improve display on 768px wide screens, doesn't look like I want but It'll do for now. Also added a hero section to the onlineCV and I think that it looks pretty cool. Check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D69, February 25th, 2019**
Watched a couple of videos of The Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy and did a simple project in Bootstrap 4. Nothing fancy.

**R1D70, February 26th, 2019**
Cleaned the HTML and CSS of my onlineCV a bit, and fixed an issue with the footer that was driving me crazy. The social icons section wasn't lining up properly on medium display. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D71, February 27th, 2019**
Today was experimentation day, not much coding but learning about how to use Puppeteer to create screenshots of my web sites and about the meta tags for social media. Let's check out how this looks on twitter: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D72, February 28th, 2019**
Today was conflict solving day. I thought had f'ed up my local repo, spent the whole day fixing merge conflicts caused by adding node_modules folder on the repo. I managed to fix this by doing things that cannot be named. Long story short, I improved the thumbnails on my Portfolio, check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D73, R1D74, March 2nd, March 3rd, 2019**
Watched a couple of videos of the Webdevelopment Bootcamp, did a demo project, learned a little about contributing to other projects using GitHub and started working on a Blog article and learned about how to prioritize my learning and how to make a schedule for the stuff I want to do. Check the project here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/musseumofcandy/html/

**R1D75, March 5th, 2019**
Added some effects to the navbar and the hero section of my online CV that trigger when the user is scrolling, also, learned about the Gitflow Workflow and have been implementing it. Check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/

**R1D76, March 6th, 2019**
Learning about Lazy Loading of images, I practiced some examples. Thinking about implementing it on my Portfolio and on my Image Gallery project.

**R1D77, March 7th, 2019**
Learned about Lazy Loading with background images and two techniques for improving the User Experience when using Lazy Load, tomorrow I'll dig a bit deeper on this topic and I'll try to implement them. Also worked on my Topic Backlog for things I want to learn and wrote some code in Java.

**R1D78, March 8th, 2019**
Implemented Lazy Loading of Background images at the Image Gallery project. It was kicking my behind at first because I was adding an event listener to DOMContentLoader instead of DOMContentLoaded, after many hours searching around I managed to fix the typo and here's the result: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/imggallery/html/index

**R1D79, March 8th, 2019**
Added Dominant Color placeholders for the images that are lazy loaded, and moved all image files to Imagekit.io, but now the images are loading so fast that I'm not even sure if the placeholders are displaying properly, can you see them?: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/imggallery/html/index

**R1D80, March 10, 2019**
* Fixed navbar padding for better look.
* Added Smooth Scroll with API.
* Added easing function to Smooth Scroll.
* Improved the layout a little.
* Removed unused code.
Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/

**R1D81, March 11, 2019**
* Added landing page with image
* Added slide down animation to landing page
* Bouncy animation on hero section elements
* Improved the animations and added scroll cue
* Added bootstrap 4
* Moved the button down and made smaller
Told you I was gonna update the Cat Photo App: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/catphotoapp/html/practice

**R1D82, March 12, 2019**
* Adjusted button animations
* Added animations to hero buttons
* Added heart beating scroll cue
* Changed animation of hero image

* Added script to wait for page to load
Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D83, March 13, 2019**
Didn't code at all today. I feel like I'm cheating for putting this entry. I just learned a little about the primite types on JavaScript and nothing else. I woke up early today and went to the gym then to work, I'm too tired to do more than that. Will maybe start fixing the Hero animation on my onlinecv tomorrow since it looks weird on mobile.

**R1D84, March 14, 2019**
* Now a Modal form pops up when Add Testimonial button is pressed
* Close Testimonial on click Post button
* Modified code to close Testimonial Form with JS
* Spent some time figuring out how to manipulate the DOM with Spring and JS

**R1D85, March 17, 2019**
I have been learning how to modify the DOM with JavaScript and started reading the book Head First Agile, since I feel that having a better understanding of it can help me a lot. I've been trying lately to keep my Trello board updates with my project's advancement. I'm not sure if I should dive into Spring now or if I'll be better off postponing it. On the other hand, I managed to somewhat read the values typed on the Modal form. Had to read a lot of code of jQuery to do so, but I was just experimenting, I'll dig deeper on DOM manipulation and find a better way.

**R1D86, March 18th, 2019**
Completed the Basic DOM Manipulation part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Also read a little bit more about Agile methodologies. Thinking about what project to brush up next since I haven't code a lot in these past few days.

**R1D87, March 19th, 2019**
Finally managed to create a function that allows you to post new Testimonies on the Testimonial section of the onlineCV. Did it with the fugliest and hackiest code you can imagine, but managed to scratch that itch, but the Testimonies are not yet persistent. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/

**R1D88, March 23rd, 2019**
It's not really Day 88 since I've been learning and trying to implement this for the last four days, but I want to count it as a single day. The onlineCV is now a SpringBoot project. I have been learning how to set up the backend on Spring and how to use Thymeleaf to create the HTML template. I managed to send information from the back end and display it on the front using Thymeleaf, and learned about Hot Swapping and make it work on STS. I'm extremely excited, it was kinda hard at the beginning but I think that I'll be able to have the Testimonial section working on the OnlineCV with a SpringBoot backend, now I have to learn how to publish the site on Heroku.

**R1D89, March 24th, 2019**
I did it, I finally did it. Well, sort of, I have been experimenting with internationalization using Thymeleaf and I managed to make it work on a test website. This is one of the things I want to implement for my OnlineCV and I'm one step closer to achieving it.

**R1D90, March 29th, 2019**
I have been deepening my understanding of working with Thymeleaf and Spring MVC, and also figuring out a Full Stack Developer roadmap for these past few days. Today I worked a little on building a landing page since I had not been coding in a while and felt bored. Once I finish the Landing Page I'll keep working on the Spring project.

**R1D91, R1D92, March 30th, March 31st, 2019**
Coded this Landing Page following along one of the lessons from the Traversy Media channel on Youtube. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/landingpage/dist/ and today I was learning how to make something persistant using Spring Boot and JPA with an H2 Database, can't wait to implement it for the Testimonials section of my own OnlineCV

**R1D93, April 1st, 2019**
Continued learning how to set up an H2 database on the DasBoot project using Spring Boot and Flyway. I got some errors when trying to set up a configuration class because Hikari doesn't have a url property. I confirmed that it was correctly connecting to the database because I used a wrong username and it crashed.

**R1D94, April 2nd, 2019**
Finished implementing JPA on Spring Boot and tested the application while running it from the website to check if the information was persistent. Ran into some issues becase the version of the course is outdated, but managed to solve the problem and make it work as intended.

**R1D95, April 3rd, R1D96 April 4th, R1D97 April 5th, 2019**
Implemented Testing features on the Spring project I was working on, ran into some issues again because the coursse is outdated but managed to make it work. Then made a cool menu with animation using HTML and CSS and once I got home I worked on making the backend information show on my OnlineCV using Spring and Thymeleaf and it kicked my ass, but then on the next day I managed to make it work.

**R1D98, April 6th, 2019**
I managed to deploy my OnlineCV on Heroku. It was even harder than getting the template to work with Thymeleaf, took me almost a whole day to do it. But in the end I managed to solve it, the issue was with the way Spring Boot builds the .jar file. But here it is, finally:https://anubisonlinecv.herokuapp.com/ The Testimonials are being fed to the website from the Spring backend.

**R1D99, April 9th, 2019**
Since 6th of April I have been learning how to set a form and bind it using Thymeleaf and Spring Boot. Got a little bored of all the theory and followed a video about how to create a cool CSS Hamburger Menu. Today I managed to post a new Testimony using the form, Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + jQuery. Doesn't work as perfectly as I had hoped so, but it's a start.

**R1D100, April 14th, 2019**
Testimonials can now be added. Right now I haven't implemented any database functionality, so the information is only being added to the Stub repository. I have not implemented the functionality to delete or edit the testimonies, but I'll do it at a later time. This past 100 days have been a lot of fun. But I haven't had enough of this, who said round two?
