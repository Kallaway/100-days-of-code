# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 Day 1: February 1, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Practiced my terminal GitHub commands so I could learn how to do pull requests. Worked through the functions chapter in Elequent Javascript. 

**Thoughts:** I feel very motivated today. Have been coding now since November 2018, but made a commitment to learn Javascript at a deep level.
