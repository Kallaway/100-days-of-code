# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started my first lessson today on FreeCodeCamp.org, working with HTML5

**Thoughts:** I have only dabbled in HTML during college and even then it wasn't significant.  I am excited to go more in depth with the lessons on here.  Looking ahead I am a little intimidated but I think it will be exciting nonetheless.

### Day 1: November 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS Styling for today.  I worked on changing color and size of text as well as discerning the difference and heirarchy of classes and attribute ID's.  

**Thoughts**: There were a few lessons I had to watch some videos on in order to complete.  After doing so, I realized I was overthinking simple things and knew the answer.  As I move forward I hope to fix that by putting CSS into practical use.
