# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed the **Getting Started** and **HTML5 and CSS** sections of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and started the **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** section. 
- Started building a website for some of my favorite missionaries.

**Thoughts:** The FreeCodeCamp sections were mostly review but there were a few nuggets of new information. Bootstrap is new and fun to learn.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- Yesterday I had a little trouble thinking of a project, but today one came to me in a flash of inspiration. One of my favorite training icebreakers is a Bingo game where, instead of numbers, you win squares by finding someone who matches a characteristic (e.g. green eyes, loves spinach, etc). I remembered a Bingo game created by @muan and decided I would try to use it as the base for my game.

**Thoughts**: This is a more aggressive project than a website, but I am learning a lot!
