# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 14, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. 

**Thoughts:** Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the world's favored language. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
