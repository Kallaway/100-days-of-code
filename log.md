# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 8,2018
##### To code and get certified along the way

**Today's Progress**: Got objectives for 220-901 and 220-902 CompTIA A+ certification.

**Thoughts:** I started this the first time about a year ago and didn't keep up with it. New account, new motivation. I have been bouncing around in the IT feild trying to figure out where I really want to go.

I feel like I have been wasting very valuable time. I started a year with a suggestion to learn Objective-C. Then that turned into C, then Java, then Python and so on. Then it was the idea of Frameworks! Then turned my attention on Django. Then machine learning back to Python. Then I found a Google certification with absolutely no care of tests. Then it was back to web based HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

Now I realize I have been wasting so much time on the useless stuff and not focusing on WORKING in the feild! When I'm working I'll be able to nit pic on people that know more coding than I do. I feel like Ive gone all this way now I need to prove myself. I've been discouraged since net+ which was difficult. A+ might be a lil easier and then more doors will open up. I hope.

This does not mean I'm giving up on coding. Just has to take smaller steps. Really master some hardware stuff then back into software. Hawaii is coming up soon I wish I could go out there with a sense of accomplishment.
