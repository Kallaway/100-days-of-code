# 100 Days Of Code - Log
#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 001/100  
I am going to try for 2nd rap from today!  
I learned Linux command "nslookup".  
It is used to check the status of DNS server settings. And to check DNS-related setting in DNS clients.  
To use "nslookup command" , I need to install a package called "dnsutils"  

```bash
$ sudo apttitude install dnsutils
```
```bash
$ nslookup tatatamaki.com
Server:		133.***.*.***
Address:	133.***.0.3#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	tatatamaki.com
Address: 133.***.**.***
```
#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 002/100
I have created an MyMyCertificate.
I make three files.
- Private key server.key
- CSR server.csr
- CRT server.crt

$ openssl genrsa 2048 > server.key
$ openssl req -new -key server.key > server.csr
$ openssl x509 -days 3650 -req -signkey server.key < server.csr > server.crt

Then, I write the necessary information in the configuration file.
Normally, this would work, but it didn't.
Why?? MyMyCertificate !!

Life and programming don't always work out according to the manual...Aww
I will try again tomorrow !!

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 003/100
I try At Coder from today.
I learned the "gets method", the "split method".
The "gets method" is a method to get the value entered by the keyboard from the terminal as a string.
The "split method" splits the string with the specified delimiter and returns it as an array.
Code to determine whether a number is even or odd.
It is passed as a, b in the standard input(STDIN).

a, b = gets.split(' ')
ax = a.to_i
by = b.to_i
c = ax * by

if c.even?
	puts "Even"
else
	puts "Odd"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 004/100
I try AtCoder.
https://atcoder.jp/contests/abs/tasks/abc081_a
It was supposed to be the easiest problem, but it was too hard.
But I cleard it.
The key is to write a one-line map(block)sentence.

arry = gets.chars
total = arry.map { |n| n.to_i }

p total.count(1)

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 005/100
I read about recursive functions today.
https://qiita.com/drken/items/23a4f604fa3f505dd5ad#fn1
This is a broad concept. As long as it calls itself, it is recursive.

def sum(arry)
	return 0 if arr.empty?
	top = arry.shift
	top + sum(arry)
end
p sum([1,2,3,4,5]) #=> 15

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 006/100

I learned Proc Object.
I want to use block as objects.
So, Proc is an object of the Block.
Add a parameter with & to the end of the temporary argument of a method definition.
hoge → Proc Object, &hoge → block

def foo_method(&hoge)
p hoge.call
end

foo_method { "test" }
=> "test"

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 007/100
I review for_syntax.
The process is repeated.
And, extract the elements from the array one by one and display them respectively. 

names = ['jhon', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo']
for name in names
puts name
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 008/100
I tried AtCoder. (ABC081B - Shift only)
I use "while sentence".
When the condition (if % 2 == 0) is met, assign the number divided by 2 to the variable i, and perform loop processing.
And, when the boolean is true, count is increased by 1.
When the boolean is false, it is out of the block.
Count will be assigned to the result variable as the return value.
Finally, in "result.min", output the smallest number among the return values.

n = gets.chomp.to_i
arry = gets.chomp.split(" ").map(&:to_i)

result = arry.map do |i|
	count = 0
	while i % 2 == 0 do
		i = i /2
		count += 1
	end
	count
end
puts result.min

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 009/100
Let's review "Hash" today !
What is "Hash" ?
An object of the Hash class that manages multiple data with a set of key/value combinations.
Can change the value by specifying a key.
Usse symbols, not strings, for hash keys!
But, I love Keith Richards better than Hash key !!

TheRollingStones = { Mick: "vacal", keith: "guitar", Ron: "guitar", Charlie: "Drums" }
	TheRollingStones.each do | name, part |
	puts "#{name} plays #{part}"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 010/100
Self-assignment operator using || in Ruby.
a ||= 10 will return 10 if the variable a does not exist (nil or false).
a = nil or false
a ||= 10
=> 10

But、if the variable contains a value, assign it to a and use it as the return value.
a = 20
a ||= 10
=> 20

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 011/100
I create sql table.
The basics of the SELECT statement.

CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column_name data_type constraints,
shohin_mei CHAR(4) NOT NULL
);

The columns of the got table can be output.
SELECT get_column_name, get_column_name,,,,
FROM table_name;

And, if you specify a condition, it will retrieve the data that meets the condition.
SELECT shohin_mei, shohin_bunrui
FROM shohin
WHERE shohin b_bunrui = 'foo';

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 012/100
I tried AtCoder. (A - Century)
This question's point is Algorithm and .floor method.

n = gets.chomp.to_i
x = (n + 99) / 100
puts x.floor

When I was solving this problem, I thought again today. 
I'm not very good at thinking of algorithms.
It's fatal, but I have to do a lot of work and get used to the patterns.

I remember famous Japanese comedians saying, "Other people's children and bitter melons grow up fast."
Others are strangers. Don't worry about it!
Is it possible for adults to improve their academic skills in a subject they are not good at? It's an experiment with my own body!
I will do my best!!

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 013/100
I tried AtCoder. (A - Square Inequality )
No particular point.
It's a redundant code, but I did it without looking anything up just to make it work.

arry = gets.split(" ").map { |n| (n.to_i) **2 }

if arry[0] + arry[1] < arry[2]
puts "Yes"
else
puts "No"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 014/100
I tried AtCoder. (A. Div)
Today's problem was not specifically related to ruby.
Just read the question text and answer.
Literacy is important.

n = gets.chomp.to_i
puts n-1

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 015/100
I tried AtCoder.(A. Rotate)

This sentence will cause an error.
arry = gets.split('')
s = arry.rotate
puts s.join('')

It was cause O.k.2
s = gets
puts s[1]+s[2]+s[0]

W~h~y~ AtCoder~?? said.(In the style of Atsugiri_Jason.)
I don't have a choice. I'll settle for this.

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 016/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Difference Max)

I wrote first code. But, this code is error.
ab = gets.split(' ')
front_part = ab.max.to_i
cd = gets.split(' ')
back_part = cd.min.to_i
puts front_part - back_part

It is next code. But, this code is error. 
ab = gets.split(' ').max.to_i
cd = gets.split(' ').min.to_i
puts ab - cd

Third time's a charm !!
Success!!!
a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
c, d = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
puts [a, b].max - [c, d].min

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 017/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Health M Death)
This time, I was able to attack it simply with an "if statement".
The point is to perform a surplus calculation(operator => %).

m, h = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if h % m == 0
puts "Yes"
else
puts "No"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 018/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - I Scream)
This is an ice cream problem.
I'm going to have ice cream today.
A taste of home after a long absence, Blue Seal !!

a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
	if a + b >= 15 && b >= 8
		puts 1 
	elsif a + b >= 10 && b >= 3
		puts 2
	elsif a + b >= 3
		puts 3
	else
		puts 4
	end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 019/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Discount)
Use method String#to_f to get the decimal point.
You get what you pay for.

a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_f)
discount = (1 - b / a) * 100
p discount

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 020/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Star)
I remembered the Fizzbuzz Quiz.
Good old days~!

x = gets.chomp.to_i
(1..100).each do |n|
	if (x + n)  % 100 == 0
		puts n
	else
		next
	end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 021/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Vanishing Pitch)
Use the conditional operator　"||".
Lately, I've been enjoying watching Major League Baseball player Otani's activities !!
Big fly !! OooootaniSaaaan !!

v, t, s, d = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
invisible_ball_start = v * t
invisible_ball_finish = v * s
if invisible_ball_start > d || invisible_ball_finish < d
puts "Yes"
else
puts "No"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 022/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Very Very Primitive Game)
It took me a long time.
In the end, the output was just the opposite.
Fall and fall, but I get up and keep going. Like a Rolling stone !!

a, b, c = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if c == 0 && a <= b
puts "Aoki"
elsif c == 1 && a < b
puts "Aoki"  
else
puts "Takahashi"
end

a, b, c = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if c == 0
puts a <= b ? "Aoki" : "Takahashi"
elsif c == 1
puts a < b ? "Aoki" : "Takahashi"
end

a, b, c = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if c == 0 && a <= b
puts "Aoki"
elsif c == 0 && a > b
puts "Takahashi"
elsif c == 1 && a < b
puts "Aoki"
elsif c == 1 && a >= b
puts "Takahashi"
else
puts  "Aoki"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 023/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Slot)
I would like to use a method and go for it, but I'm not sure what I'm capable of right now.
Keep trying!!

c = gets.to_s.chars
if c[0] == c[1] && c[1] == c[2]
puts "Won"
else
puts "Lost"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 024/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Three-Point Shot)
Received as an array, sorted, and calculated.
It's so redundant!
Redundant, which sounds like Linda Linda.
A punk band apparently named after a Japanese punk band(THE BLUE HEARTS).
COOL !!
https://twitter.com/LAPublicLibrary/status/1395485852579495936?s=20

arry = gets.to_s.split.map{ |e| e.to_i }
s = arry.sort
score = s[1] - s[0]
result = score < 3 ? "Yes" : "No"
puts result

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 025/100
I forgot to tweet this yesterday.
Guard Clause is one of the techniques to avoid deep nesting of conditional branches, 
and is sometimes translated as "guard clause", "guard condition", or "guard syntax".
It is sometimes referred to as "early return" because of its behavior.

def ranking(point)
return 'gold' if point > 90
return 'silver' if point > 70
return 'bronze' if point > 50
'PrizeForParticipation'
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 026/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - Brick)
I'm getting used to that A problem.
Let's work on problem B next time.

n, w = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
brick = n / w
puts brick

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 027/100
I tried AtCoder.(B - 180°)
First try B problem.
It was difficult, but I managed to get through it.
Keep going !!

s = http://gets.to_s.split("")
x = s.reverse.join
y = http://x.tr('69', '96')
puts y

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 028/100
I tried AtCoder.(A - ABC Preparation)
Today first, I tried problem B, but it was too difficult to solve.
I had to start from problem A again.

a = gets.to_s.split.map{ |e| e.to_i }
puts a.min 

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 029/100
Today, I studied about "Shinara".
"Sinatra" is Web Application Framework.
"Sinatra" is very hard. But, I keep is going!!
Because, "That's life ♪"
And,
I'm trying with the A problem challenge.
(A - Determinant)

a, b = gets.to_s.split.map{ |e| e.to_i }
c, d = gets.to_s.split.map{ |e| e.to_i }
puts result = a * d - b * c

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 030/100
Today, I studied JSON.
It is adopted a lightweight data representation format.
It is characterized by its ability to describe data structures that are easy to handle from programming languages, such as hashes and arrays.
Here are a few of the objects.
A set of names and values. A name/value pair is called a "memba" of an object.
It has four "membas" : name, nickname, age, and position.

{
"name" : {
"first": "shohei",
"last": "otani"
},
"nickname": "ooootanisaaan",
"age": 26,
"position": ["picher", "batter", "runner"]
}

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 031/100
I tried AtCoder.(B - Do you know the second highest mountain?)
B problem is difficult. I googled it.
I've turned to the sort_by method.
https://docs.ruby-lang.org/ja/latest/method/Enumerable/i/sort_by.html

n = gets.to_i
name_height = Array.new(n){gets.split}
puts name_height.sort_by{_2.to_i}[-2][0]

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 032/100
I tried AtCoder.(B - 200th ABC-200)
The point of today's problem is to use times_method.
And it's about using logic (n % 200 == 0).

n, k = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
k.times do |i|
if n % 200 == 0
n /= 200
else
n = n*1000 + 200
end
end
puts n

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 033/100
Minitest is a framework for testing.
Write "require 'minitest/autorun'".
Write the relative path to the file you want to test.
Specify with 'require_relative'.
Write the method name as "test_".
Check for methods marked with "test_".
"asset_equal" , if a and b are the same, pase. 

require 'minitest/autorun'
require_relative '../piyo/foobar'

class FooBar < Minitest::Test
def test_foobar
assert_equal b, a
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 034/100
I studied object-oriented.
I used is this book "https://www.shoeisha.co.jp/book/detail/9784798134659"
First of all, I learned 3 important Features of object-oriented.
- Inheritance Sharing the characteristics of a class. Abstraction <= Embodiment
- Encapsulation Clarify the scope of functions and data.
- Polymorphism Even if the class is the same, there are differences in the behavior of each object.
	Use properly.

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 035/100
I studied json_file's exporting & importing.

# How to convert a Hash to a JSON string and write it to a JSON file.
require 'json'
File.open("where to save the file", 'w') do |file|
str = JSON.dump(Export as a hash, file_object)
end

# Read a JSON file and convert it to Ruby Hash.
File.open("./sample.json") do |file|
hash = JSON.load(file)
p hash
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 036/100
A web system has a three-tier structure: web server, application server, and database server.
Thin, WEBrick is a member of the application server.

I try to use WEBrick.
# write to a Gemfile.
gem 'webrick'

# write to a myapp.rb file.
require 'webrick'

# I run what I wrote in my Gemfile.
bundle exec ruby myapp.rb

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 037/100
I tried AtCoder.(B - Intersection)
I used Ternary operator.
This "n = gets.to_i" doesn't make any particular sense,
but I've implemented it.
Using ternary operators is simple and cool!！

n = gets.to_i
a = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
x = (b.min) - (a.max)
puts x >= 0 ? x+1 : 0

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 038/100
I tried AtCoder(B - Palindrome with leading zeros).
Very hard question...
But, I cleared it!
This question's point is regex "/0*&/".
By combining this regex with the sub method, I was able to create the process I wanted to get.
I'm tired today. I'll try again tomorrow!!
[String\#sub \(Ruby 3\.0\.0 リファレンスマニュアル\)](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/ja/3.0.0/method/String/i/sub.html)
n = gets.chomp.to_s
x = n.sub(/0*$/, "")
if n == n.reverse
puts "Yes"
elsif x == x.reverse
puts "Yes"
else
puts "No"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 039/100
I studied Test Driven Development.
The steps of the TDD cycle.
1. Think about your next goal.
2. write a test that demonstrates that goal
3. run that test and make it fail (Red)
4. write the code for the goal
5. make the test you wrote in step 2 succeed (Green)
6. refactor the code until the test passes (Refactor)
7. repeat steps 1~6
Point is writing from the goal.
Think small and build up.

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 040/100
I studies inject method.
It's called the method of doing Convolution operation.
I really don't know what that means mathematically.It's really hard.
For now, I understand it as Ruby's method.

Step1, The first iteration will put # in hex.
Step2, The string created by "hex + n.to_s(16).rjust(2, '0')" in the block will go into hex in the next iteration.
Step3, When the iteration process reaches the end, the return value of the block becomes the return value of the inject method itself.

n.to_s(16).rjust(2, '0')
def to_hex(r, g, b)
[r, g, b].inject('#') do |hex, n|
hex + n.to_s(16).rjust(2, '0')
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 041/100
I tried AtCoder(A \- Rock\-paper\-scissors).
I also tried to test code today.
I used the knowledge,  I learned in the circle reading session.
Nice autput !! keep going!

x, y = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
def atcoder(x, y)
if x == y
x
else
3 - x - y
end
end

require 'minitest/autorun'

class AtcoderTest < Minitest::Test
def test_atocoder
assert_equal 1, atcoder(2,0)
assert_equal 2, atcoder(2,2)
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 042/100
Caution! About the type of the hash key.
I've been wrong about hash key all this time.
If the key type is string, specify string.
If it is a symbol, specify the symbol.

<h1>memo</h1>
<div class="index">
<p><%= @hash["title"] %></p>
<p><%= @hash["content"] %></p>
</div>

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 043/100
I tried AtCoder(A - kcal)
I wrote some more test code today.
And, I wrote according to the procedure in the TDD rules.

a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_f)
def kcal(a, b)
puts b / 100 * a
end

require 'minitest/autorun'
class KcalTest < Minitest::Test
def test_kcal
assert_equal 90, kcal(45, 200)
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 044/100
I tried AtCoder(A - ABC Preparation)
For the first time, I could write one line of code !!

puts  gets.to_s.split.map(&:to_i).min

And, I wrote test code ver.

def abc(arry)
 arry.to_i
end

arry = gets.to_s.split.map(&:to_i).min
abc(arry)

require 'minitest/autorun'

class AbcTest < Minitest::Test
def test_abc
assert_equal 3, abc(3)
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 045/100
I studied about splat deployment.
This is used when you want to expand an array and pass it as multiple arguments.
It can also be used as a method argument.

irb(main):009:1* def greeting(*names)
irb(main):010:1*   "#{names.join(' and ')} say, Hello"
irb(main):011:0> end
=> :greeting
irb(main):012:0> greeting('Jhon','Paul')
=> "Jhon and Paul say, Hello"

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 046/100
I tried AtCoder(B - Nuts)
It was difficult to pass arguments to the method.
It passed the test successfully.
This time, I passed an array as the argument, but if it is a string, use *arry to expand the splat.

a = [6,17,28]

def nuts(arry)
total = 0
arry.each do |x|
if x > 10
total += (x - 10)
end
end
total
end

require 'minitest/autorun'

class NutsTest < Minitest::Test
def test_nuts
assert_equal 25, nuts([6,17,28])
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 047/100
Today I reviewed　about Guard Clause.
Basic Form　=> return foo if bar
It is said that it is good manners to leave the bottom line of a sentence with a guard clause blank.

As an aside...
Today is PaulMcCartney Birthday !!
irb(main):016:1* def play(name)
irb(main):017:1*   return 'name,Please' if name.nil?
irb(main):018:1*
irb(main):019:2*   if name == 'Paul'
irb(main):020:2*     'I play bass guitar!'
irb(main):021:2*   elsif name == 'Ring'
irb(main):022:2*     'I play drums!'
irb(main):023:2*   else
irb(main):024:2*     'I play guitar'
irb(main):025:1*   end
irb(main):026:0> end
=> :play
irb(main):027:0> play('Paul')
=> "I play bass guitar!"
irb(main):028:0> play(nil)
=> "name,Please"
irb(main):029:0>


#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 048/100
I tried AtCoder(B - AtCoder Condominium)
I used Convolution operation today.
Code is easy but, It was hard to come up with logic.

a, b = gets.to_s.split.map(&:to_i)

n = (1..a).map{|i| i * 100}
sum_n = n.inject(0) {|result, n| result + n} * b
k = (1..b).map{|i| i += 0}
sum_k = k.inject(0) {|result, k| result + k} * a
puts sum_n + sum_k

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 049/100
"Ruby feels good when I get it right!!"
Here's what Matz had to say. 
I've been thinking about my experiences with Ruby and how good it felt.
My first experience is with the ternary operator.

Before refactoring.
`shots = []
scores.each do |s|
shots << if s == 'X'
10
else
s.to_i
end
end`

After code.
Good feeling !!!!!
`scores.each { |s| shots << ( s == 'X' ? 10 : s.to_i ) }`

Then, I got a review and was able to make it even shorter.
shots = scores.map{|s| s == 'X' ? 10 : s.to_i }`

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 050/100
I wrote the Sinatra program about memo app.
Today, I created edit page.
It's difficult. 
I hope to have it done by the end of the week.

<h1>memo</h1>
<form action="/memos/:id" method="patch">
  <% @memo.each do |memo| %>
    <% "#{memo["id"]}" %>
    <p class="title">title</p>
    <textarea name="title" id="title"><%= "#{memo["title"]}" %></textarea></P>

I was thinking about the theme of the LT meeting.
I checked the past daily reports and other documents.
I found a FizzBuzz problem and tried to solve it with ternary operators.
I do this today for a change.
Maybe,
You can make it shorter.

def fizz_buzz(x)
(x..100).each do |n|
puts (n % 15).zero? ? 'Fizz_Buzz': n.to_s
puts (n % 3).zero? ? 'Fizz' : n.to_s
puts (n % 5).zero? ? 'Buzz' : n.to_s
puts n.to_s
end
end

fizz_buzz(1)

I learned about HTTP routing.
I've been thinking about it all day.
And, I've been working on the code all day.
It's been a fucking exhausting day...
But, I've leveled up.

Don't stop learning !!

I tried AtCoder(A - Determinant)
a, b = gets.to_s.split.map{ |e| e.to_i }
c, d = gets.to_s.split.map{ |e| e.to_i }
def atcoder(a, b, c, d)
a * d - b * c
end

require 'minitest/autorun'

class AtcoderTest < Minitest::Test

assert_equal -2, atcoder(2,3,4,5)
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 054/100
I tried AtCoder(A - ReLU)
For now, today, 
I decided to use the ternary operator.
It was the fastest way to solve the problem.

x = gets.to_s.to_i
puts x >= 0 ? x : 0

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 055/100
I tried AtCoder(A - twiblr)
Today, I thought about the theme of the LT.
I finally decided on a theme: I'll talk about JSON files and Hash tags.and, about  creating a memo's application using sinatra.

a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
puts  (2*a + 100) - b

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 056/100
I did some code refactoring.

post '/memos/:id' do
memo = {
"id" => SecureRandom.uuid,
"title" => params["title"],
"content" => params["content"],
"created_at" => Time.now
}
File.open("./db/memos_#{memo["id"]}.json", 'w') do |file|
JSON.dump(memo, file)
end
redirect to('/memos')
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 057/100
Today, The skeleton of the memo app is complete.
I implemented File.delte mehotd.
Next, arrange the design in css.

delete '/memos/:id' do
memo = { "id" => params["id"], "title" => params["title"], "content" => params["content"], "created_at" => "Time.now"}
File.delete("./json/memos_#{memo["id"]}.json")
redirect to("/memos")
end

I participated in the LT meeting today and gave a presentation.
It was great to be able to rehearse with the school mentor and get feedback.
After listening to the content of the other speakers, I realized that I still need to work harder.
I'd like to keep learning !!

I understood Enumerator_class today.
Enumerator_class includes the Enumerable_module.

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 059/100
Today I was writing css for my own memo application.
It's been a while since I wrote it, so I forgot about it.
I wrote it while researching.
I'm about 80% done.
I hope to finish it tomorrow.

body {
font-family: 'Reggae One', cursive;
}
.container {
background-color: rgb(245,241,130);
width: 400px;
}
...more

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 060/100
Today, I continued with the creation of the memo application.
The CSS style implementation is complete.
Title mean is "Make a note!!"
I paid homage to the first album of the Sex Pistols.
It was inspired by the design of Sex Pistols first album.

What to do when you want a JSON string to be returned as a symbol when returning it as a hash object.
Add an option when converting JSON format strings to hash objects.

I made a new discovery about rubocop.
Rubocop is designed to check ruby code, and does not support erb files.
Since RuboCop itself is a big gem, there are people who think the same thing like "can't we do it in erb?" or "I wish we could do it in erb", And there is such an Issue standing.
In response to this, Mr.bbatsov, who is probably the administrator, replied,
He says "It's outside the scope of RuboCop."

I learned debug methods.
I tried Byebug.
After invoking Byebug, 
I can use help + command_name to display the description and shortened command.

I reviewed the binding.irb that I was taught before.
I wrote 'bindin.irb'. That way, I can create a breakpoint.
So, irb will start, and I can type in the code, I want to try.

It's been a while since I solved Atcoder today.
A problem. It's been a while, so I wasn't confident, but I was able to solve it.

A. twiblr
a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
puts  (2*a + 100) - b

A. Heavy Rotation
a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
puts  (2*a + 100) - b

A - box
n, a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
puts n - a + b

I reviewed SQL today.
I set up the environment on my Mac OS.
Then I logged in and changed the user.
After that, I created a database, created tables, and added columns.
INSERT sentence and SELECT sentence.

shop=# select * from shohin;
shop=# INSERT INTO Shohin (shohin_id, shohin_mei, shohin_bunrui, hanbai_tanka, shiire_tanka, torokubi) VALUES ('0004', '時計', 'アクセサリ', 100000, 80000, '2021-07-07');
INSERT 0 1

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 068/100
I tried AtCoder(B - Palindrome with leading zeros)
It was difficult.

n = gets.chomp.to_s
x = n.sub(/0*$/, "")
if n == n.reverse
puts "Yes"
elsif x == x.reverse
puts "Yes"
else
puts "No"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 069/100
I tried AtCoder(B - Many Oranges)
Today's problem was also difficult.....
Or rather, I almost couldn't solve it on my own.
I understand the ruby code, but I can't understand the problem itself.
Full search...

a,b,w = gets.split.map(&:to_f)
w = w*1000
if (w/a).floor < (w/b).ceil
puts  "UNSATISFIABLE"
else
puts "#{(w/b).ceil} #{(w/a).floor}"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 070/100
I learned git.
Today I got the following command

git switch
git restore
git diff
git reflog
git cherry-pick
git stash
git grep

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 071/100
Today I refactored the memo application.
I understood RESTfull URI.

post '/memos' do
memo= { id: SecureRandom.uuid, title: params[:title], content: params[:content], created_at: Time.new }
File.open("./json/memos_#{memo[:id]}.json", 'w') do |file|
JSON.dump(memo,file)
end
redirect to("/memos/#{h(memo[:id])}")
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 072/100
I tried AtCoder(A - Plural Form)

n = gets.to_s.chomp
unless n[-1] == "s"
print n.concat "s"
else
print n.concat "es"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 073/100
I thought about how to extract a json file.
It turns out that the return value is different for the pattern without the .first method and the pattern with it.
It unresolved.  But a step forward.未解決

irb(main):005:0> file = Dir.glob("./json/memos_f51cdea2-fb63-4167-91a1-ec642f875
06e.json")
=> ["./json/memos_f51cdea2-fb63-4167-91a1-ec642f87506e.json"]

irb(main):006:0> file = Dir.glob("./json/memos_f51cdea2-fb63-4167-91a1-ec642f875
06e.json").first
=> "./json/memos_f51cdea2-fb63-4167-91a1-ec642f87506e.json"

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 074/100
I tried AtCoder(A - Not)
x = gets.to_s.to_i
puts x == 0 ? 1 : 0

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 075/100
I studied PostgreSQL.
I made a database.
And, I created a table in that database and inserted data.
[ged/ruby\-pg: A PostgreSQL client library for Ruby](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg)

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'pg'

# Output a table of current connections to the DB
conn = PG.connect( dbname: 'postgres' )
conn.exec( "INSERT into piyo values ('05', 'title5', 'memo5' );" )
conn.exec( 'select * from piyo' ) do |result|
result.each do |row|
puts row
end
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 076/100
I tried AtCoder(A - Don't be late)
This is a problem where an integer is given, but sometimes the result is a decimal point when giving the speed in seconds.
For the reason, I used to_f method.

d, t, s = gets.split.map(&:to_f)
puts d/s <= t ? "Yes" : "No"

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 077/100
I tried AtCoder(A - Takoyaki)
Point is Float#ceil.
[Float\#ceil \(Ruby 3\.0\.0 リファレンスマニュアル\)](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/ja/3.0.0/method/Float/i/ceil.html)
def made_takoyaki(n, x, t)
puts ((n/x).ceil * t).to_i
end

n, x, t = gets.split.map(&:to_f)
made_takoyaki(n, x, t)

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 078/100
I tried AtCoder(A - Rainy Season)
It's a dirty fucking code....
But this is what I'm capable of now.
Studying again tomorrow !!

s = gets.to_s.chomp
if s == "RRR"
puts "3"
elsif s == "RRS"
puts "2"
elsif s == "SRR"
puts "2"
elsif s == "SSS"
puts '0'
else
puts "1"
end

#100DaysOfCode 2nd_rap Day: 079/100
I tried AtCoder(A - Air Conditioner)
First time!
I solved a problem in under two minutes!!!

x = gets.to_i
puts x >= 30 ? 'Yes' : 'No'

I'd also like to introduce this one, which I think is the fastest song in the world.
