### Day 1: May 4, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today this morning I continued to work on my portfolio website even knowing that my website is still naked. I wanted to create a more custom look after reviewing a few other portfolio websites. I wanted to add a better and more captivating look. So, I started to work on a rotating text change for my landing text. I also changed my menu toggler links and removed the about me page. Today is my first day back at work so I will be ending my coding session for the day. 

**Thoughts:** My thoughts about the changes I have made to my portfolio website are starting to make my creativity juices in my brain kick into gear. I have come up with a few ways of bring that eye catchcing effect to my website hopefully this will be a great practice to improve my HTML & CSS skills.
