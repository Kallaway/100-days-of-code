# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up github repo, tweeted that I'm starting the challenge.
Created a Day1 folder in my repo, and am planning on making a simple counter app.
I will be using Express, Bulma, and Fontawesome to start.

**Thoughts** 
I was thinking today about me being older than all of my classmates in the bootcamp, and so was thinking of projects to do with a theme of "old dog, new tricks".

### Day 2: Saturday, October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I combined the simple counter with a solution for the FizzBuzz challenge.

**Thoughts** 
It's certainly not pretty but it works. I added an extra span to display the multiples of 3 and 5, and I kinda like it. That way, you can compare the number and the word for yourself and see if it works.

### Day 3: Sunday, October 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added some documentation on how the counter works, and why it displays seemingly random text next to multiples of 3 and 5

**Thoughts** 
I do need to work on making my sites more accessible and with better user experiences, so this is good practice.

### Day 4: Monday, October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a site using just html and css and flexbox via Bulma.

**Thoughts**

### Day 6: Wednesday, October 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-visited day 3, and added some sounds to the counter

**Thoughts** 
I figure I should add some annoying sounds to the counter, for audio learners.
