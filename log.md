# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### DAY2

Fixed the added feature of my baby project.
Added style to dynamically generated element ^^

### DAYS 3

DAY ３
Discovered there are always things I missed even among things I thought basic ... again.
freecodecamp

### DAYS 4

Started a project using freecodecamp! It's a Tribute site. I made items that I learned so far at freecodecamp.

### DAYS 5

Gee I learned new stuff about CSS today on FreeCodeCamp.

### DAYS 6 2021/02/28

Started implementing a new color-picker in the app which tells you the name of a color in an image. I'm using canvas and getImageData. imgData contains

### DAYS 7 2021/3/1

Understanding how to use canvas element to put an image onto it and ultimately get rgb value of a pixel under the cursor

### DAYS 8 2021/3/2

Edited to render a image in canvas element and added a parent element (canvas container) to make the image responsive to the browser size. (canvas element by itself cannot be set to 100% width. Must make container 100% wide and set canvas width = container width)

### DAYS 9

Worked on canvas. I learned an eventlistner "onload", and I need to set it to obtain the size of the original image that I want to manipulate.
I also learned window.addEventListner.

### DAYS 10

Continued to work on canvas

### DAYS 11 2021/03/05

Continued to work on canvas
Now I know canvas.getContext("2d") + ctx.fillStyle + ctx.fillRect = background-color
And you can size canvas element in HTML, JS (ctx.fillRect) or in CSS for filled color.

### DAYS 12 2021/03/06

Figured out the way to fit an image within a canvas while preserving the image aspect ratio.

### DAYS 13
