### Day 1: 9 januari, 2020

**Today's Progress**: starting to write the html yet want to design how website look. try to use "john green" web profile

**Thoughts**: 
  1. so minimal effort that i have done today, time so much wasted on last night event that should be held make me so much less productive. even if i know this is a shitty reason.
  2. struggling in css method to modify the look of the website to look same as the model. 

**Link(s) to work**: the model --> http://www.johngreenbooks.com/
