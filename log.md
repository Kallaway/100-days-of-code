# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning python.

**Thoughts:** I practised algorithms in python , but I feel that my basics are not strong enough. Most of the time i just look at answers and I am facing problems. So I started practising Python in hackerrank. I do a Problem, mostly i dont know the concept, So, I read the concept in Geekforgeeks or w3schools and learn.
