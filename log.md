# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Wednesday, April 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent a bunch of time figuring out how to work on my old projects with my new setup (Git and Oh My Zhs). Reviewed WTJ code to extract list of job openings. Spent a bunch of time trying to extract the JSON data in between script tags from the job description URL. Ended up posting on StackOverflow. Hopefully someone can help out with this otherwise I don't know how I'm going to move forward!

**Thoughts** Lots of time reviewing the work I did a couple of weeks ago, Googling and OverStackflowing, not a lot of time coding and no progress made as far as the project goes (ie still haven't cleared the roadblock to extract job description)

## Day 2: Thursday, April 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made a lot of progress! 
* Learned how to use Node.js to navigate and fill out form on ameli.fr 
* Practiced using git commands to add projects that were started on local environment to GitHub repositories
* Reviewed feedback I got on StackOverflow. Didn't solve my problem but I learned more about asking the right questions and how to look for solutions online

**Thoughts** There's so much to learn! Great community that's super helpful but seems to be big opportunities for good teachers and people who enjoy solving problems for others.

## Day 3: Friday, May 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Found a solution to my `<script type="application/ld+json">` scraping problem! It's a little bit dirty and not very elegant but it works! 
* Also worked on a new personal blog project using Ghost and Digital Ocean. 
* Struggled (a LOT!) with the push to GitHub :/
* TODO: Need to take the time to give feedback on StackOverflow: explain that proposed solution didn't work and share the work-around I found.

**Thoughts** So much exciting stuff to do. Feels like the #100DaysOfCode focus on only counting project time and not online courses or tutorials time really spurred me on. Feels like I haven't made this much progress since the 1 week sessions with VonStruddle :) Feel very focused and driven. Long may it last.

## Day 4: Saturday, May 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Restarted personal blog project from scratch. Was working fine and then it wasn't :/

**Thoughts** Feels like no progress at all! Destroyed Digital Ocean droplet I had created last night and redid entire Ghost / Digital Ocean setup following tutorial. Worked fine for an hour or so and now site seems to be down even though I was only editing a post in the Ghost editor! Weird. Oh well, I'm giving up for the day. Don't want to spend the whole weekend on this.
